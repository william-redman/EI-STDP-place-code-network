# EI-STDP-place-code-network
This repository hosts the code for the EI STDP place code network used in Levy et al. "A neuronal code for space in hippocampal coactivity dynamics independent of place fields"  2021 (Fig. 1).

The script STDP_DIFF_TRACK_ANALYSIS_PIPELINE.m houses all the experiments and stores all the relevant computed variables. All free parameters are set to the values reported in the above mentioned pre-print.
